# DataScienceProjekt
In this repository one will find the files for our Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Project in the Datascience Course at the University of Applied Sciences in Wedel. We tried three different approaches:

* LightGBM: An extensive library supporting the classification by gradient boosting methods.
* Keras: a Neural Net approach developed in Keras
* Neural Net: Another, second neural net

When tested, all approaches worked quite well. LightGBM was reasonable quick in training and detection, but the Keras implementation had shown a quite small improvement in regard to classification quality.
